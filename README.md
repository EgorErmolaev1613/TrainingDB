# TrainingDB
This is my training project where I used a database connection with login and user registration functionality. Used technologies: MySQL 8.x, JDBC, JavaFX.
Just a demo project. By structure:
The src/main folder contains the main Java classes, which include controllers for scenes with functionality attached to them.
The DataBaseHandler class is a class for connecting to a database and 2 methods - registering a user and writing it to the database and querying the user to the database for subsequent authorization.
The resources/com/exsample/demo1 folder contains .fxml files that serve as descriptions of the scenes in the application
